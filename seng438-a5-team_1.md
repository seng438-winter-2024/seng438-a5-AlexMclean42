# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing

For our assessment, we selected the CDS.DAT file. For compatibility with C-SFRAT, we converted it to a CSV, and included certain (inconsequential) fields. This is stored as DATA.csv at the root of this directory.

We selected the truncated logistic and IFR generalized Salvia and Bollinger models based on the log-likelihood. This tells how close the model generated curves are to the actual data points. Furthermore, the mean and median critic scores for each of these models were the highest of all tested models. We double checked with a qualitative analysis of the graphs.

After careful examination of the fault graph and considering the quality and characteristics of the data presented, we have decided to utilize the entire range of data for our analysis. The data quality has been assessed as high, with no significant reasons to suspect inaccuracies or errors. Moreover, the dataset represents the system's performance during its operational phase, which is crucial for understanding its actual reliability in a real-world context. Given that there are no apparent outliers and anomalies, it is justifiable to include the full spectrum of data. This comprehensive approach ensures that we take into account all available information, thereby providing a holistic view of the system's reliability throughout its timeline.
